I built a cloud-native food bookmarking app using AWS Amplify, Lambda, DynamoDB, and Cognito. 
I integrated third-party APIs (Google Places/Yelp), designed a responsive React frontend, and used serverless backend APIs with CI/CD via Amplify. 
The app is live and demonstrates end-to-end architecture from UX to observability."

Features of the app:
✅ Save a new restaurant with name, tags, notes, Instagram link

✅ Auto-fetch details via Google Places/Yelp (timings, price, etc.)

✅ Filter saved places by type (brunch, dessert, date night)

✅ Map view or grid layout of your saved spots

✅ Deployed on yourdomain.com (use Route53 or Amplify's subdomain)

✅ Well-written README + architecture diagram
